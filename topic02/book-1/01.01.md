# Get Git

### Windows OS
If you're on Windows, download the  **GitHub Desktop**, from [here](https://desktop.github.com/) which includes Git, and use the Git Shell for your terminal.


### Mac
You can install Git automatically. To do this, open the Terminal application from spotlight and type `git`. This will prompt Git to install the rest of the command line tools for Git. This should only take a few minutes. It will ask if you would like to download Xcode, which you can ignore.

### Linux

You can use the package-management tool that comes with your distribution. For Fedora use:

~~~bash
$ sudo yum install git-all 
~~~

For Debian use:

~~~bash
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
~~~

## Tell Git who you are
You will to tell git who you are so that it can set an identity on all repos created and track changes. To set a global identity for all repos on the machine enter the following:
~~~bash
$ git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
~~~

## Clone a Repository

### Clone the samples repository
Select a location on your machine where you would like to keep the code examples taken from the weekly talks. Open a terminal window in that location and clone the samples repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/fxwalsh/node-samples-2018.git
```

This should create a new folder called *node-dev-2018*. Open the folder and you should see the node samples from the lecture slides. We will use this repository for our example code as the module progresses. You will need to *pull* the repository each week to get the latest samples.

## Create a repository
You can think of a repository as a project folder with all the related files inside of it.
![git repos](./img/repos.png)
You intialise a folder as a  Git repository and Git will start tracking the changes to that folder. Any files added, subtracted or changed are tracked and time stamped by Git. That's version control.

You're going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git repository.
Make a new folder by opening a terminal window at the location where you want the examples on your machine. Enter the follwoing commands to make a new directory called *node-labs-2018* and then change directory into it :
~~~bash
$ mkdir node-labs-2018
$ cd node-labs-2018
~~~

Now initialise the folder as a Git repo:
~~~
$ git init
~~~
To check that it's a Git repository, type ``git status`` and if returns something like 'On branch master ....', you've got a new local repo!

#Add to the repository
Open a text editor. Now write a couple of lines of text:

~~~text
#Node Development Practical Labs
~~~

and save the file as readme.md in the *node-labs-2018* folder.

### Status, Add and Commit Changes
Next check the status of your repository to find out if there have been changes. Below in this terminal, you should still be within the 'node-labs-2018' you created. See if there are changes listed:

~~~bash
$ git status
~~~

Then add the file you just created to the files you'd like to commit (aka save) to change.

~~~bash
$ git add readme.md
~~~

Finally, commit those changes to the repository's history with a short description of the updates.

~~~bash
$ git commit -m "<your commit message>"
~~~

### Make More Changes

Now add another line to *readme.md* and save.

In terminal, you can view the difference between the file now and how it was at your last commit.

~~~bash
$ git diff
~~~

Now with what you just learned above, commit this latest change.
