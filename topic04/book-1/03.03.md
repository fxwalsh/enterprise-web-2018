# Report Generation

At the moment, the tests report back to the console. You'll now use **Mochawesome** to generate a unit test report that visualises the test results.

+ Install Mochawesome to you dev dependencies.
```
npm install --save-dev mochawesome
```

+ To output the results, update your test script in *package.json* to include mochawsome as the reporter:
```javascript
"test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test mocha --require babel-core/register --require babel-polyfill --reporter mochawesome"
```

+ Now run the tests again. Mochawesome will generate reports in the **/mochawesome-reports/** folder in your project
