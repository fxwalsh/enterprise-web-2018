# Set up

+ You need a working version of the Contacts api for this lab. The solution to the last lab you completed will will do. Otherwise, you can get the solution from Github.

+ Create a new folder for this lab,*node-lab4*, and copy the contents of the last lab into this folder. Update the *name* and *description* properties in **package.json** to *node-lab4*.

### Install dependencies

All the following are development dependencies and as such use the ``--save-dev`` option for installation.

+ You need **Mocha, Should and SuperTest**. Install as development dependencies into your new lab folder as follows.
```
npm install --save-dev mocha
npm install --save-dev should
npm install --save-dev supertest
```

+ You need **babel-core** and **babel-polyfill**. As we are writing code using ES6, we need to be able to transpile our unit tests using Babel. We can use the existing Babel configuration  for the lab but we need to add *babel-core* and *babel-polyfill*. Install both as a dev dependency.
```
npm install --save-dev babel-core
npm install --save-dev babel-polyfill
```

+ You need **Cross-Env**. ``NODE_ENV`` is an environment variable. ``NODE_ENV`` value is set to ‘test’ when we run our tests. We will also need to revert to 'development' when we're updating the code. Setting environment variables differs across Operating Systems/platforms. We also want to be able to set the value from a scipt. *Cross-Env* is an NPM package which uses a single command to set environment variables without worrying about the platform. Install *Cross-Env* as a development dependency:
```
npm install save-dev cross-env
```

### Create your first test

+ To enable us to test the app, we need to export the app object from *index.js* in the base folder of the project. Modify the *index.js* as follows:
```javascript
...
export const app = express(); //replaces the previous const app = express();
...
```
+ Create  new folder called *test* in the root folder of the lab. Create a new file called ``/test/testContactsApi.js`` with the following content.
```javascript
import supertest from 'supertest';
import {app} from './../index.js';
import should from 'should'; // eslint-disable-line
// UNIT test begin
describe('Contacts API unit test', function() {
  this.timeout(120000); // eslint-disable-line
  // #1 return a collection of json documents
  it('should return collection of JSON documents', function(done) {
    // calling home page api
    supertest(app)
    .get('/api/contacts')
    .expect('Content-type', /json/)
    .expect(200) // This is the HTTP response
    .end(function(err, res) {
        // HTTP status should be 200
        res.status.should.equal(200);
        done();
    });
  });
});
```

## Update package.json
+ Replace the *scripts* entry in the *package.json* file with the following.
```json
"scripts": {
   "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development nodemon --ignore hackerNews/* --exec babel-node index.js",
   "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test mocha --require babel-core/register --require babel-polyfill --reporter mochawesome --exit",
   "pretest": "eslint *.js ./api/*.js ./test/*.js"
 }
```
The above script entry for test will set ``NODE_ENV`` to test and then run mocha against the files matching the pattern provided (i.e. by default it'll pick up the test in the test folder). You also need to update the start script to set ``NODE_ENV`` to 'development' before starting the server.
**The pretest script is optional**. If you are linting, it might be a good idea to include a "full lint" before each test. When you run the test script, the pretest will be run automatically.

+ Now test by running the test script:
```
npm run test
```
You should see something similar to the following:

## Include Mockgoose

The current test is an integration test as it requires a real, functioning database. If we want our tests to just apply to the service interface then we should remove the depenency on the database. **Mockgoose** will allow us to test the code in isolation from the database

+ Install Mockgoose as a development dependency
```
npm install --save-dev mockgoose
```

+ In our current solution, we connect to the database with the following statement:
```javascript
...
mongoose.connect(process.env.mongoDB);
...
```
+ Replace this statement in *index.js*  with the following code:

~~~javascript
import {Mockgoose} from 'mockgoose';
...
// Connect to database
if (nodeEnv == 'test') {
  // use mockgoose for testing
  const mockgoose=new Mockgoose(mongoose);
  mockgoose.prepareStorage().then(()=>{
    mongoose.connect(process.env.mongoDB);
  });
} else {
  // use real deal for everything else
  mongoose.connect(process.env.mongoDB);
}

mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('MongoDB connection error: '+ err);
    process.exit(-1);
});
...
~~~

This code will wrap the existing Mongoose object with Mockgoose only if the ``NODE_ENV`` is set to test (i.e. we're running test cases).

+ Now test again by running the test script:
```
npm run test
```
This time the first test run  will take longer as Mockgoose will create a local Mongodb in memory for the test. Subsequent tests will be faster though
