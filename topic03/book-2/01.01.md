# Set up

In your git lab repository, create a new folder called **node-lab3**. Copy the contents of last weeks lab, **node-lab2** into this folder.

If you don't have the last lab, you can get it from the [samples](https://github.com/fxwalsh/node-samples-2018.git) repository on Github.

Check it works as before by running:

```
npm start
```

### Get Mongo, Mongoose and Express Async Handler
![Mongoose](./img/download.png)
+ Download and install Mongodb by selecting the relevant installer for your OS:

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)

Follow the instructions and accept all defaults.

All going well, you should be able to start MongoDB with default settings  by opening a command window and enter:
``javascript
mongod
``


+ Open a terminal in  folder and install Mongoose as follows:

```npm install -save mongoose```

+ We will be using Mongoose with the async await pattern. To help us deal with rejected promises in Express, download the express-async-handler from NPM:

```npm install -save express-async-handler```
