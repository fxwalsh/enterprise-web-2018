# Introduction
This lab will create authentication with JSON Web Tokens for the hacker news solution in previous labs. You will include the jwt token with every request, meaning that we don’t need sessions. This way you don’t need cookies, but clients of the service will need to save the JWT in localStorage or other places on the frontend.

In this lab you will:

+ creating a /api/users route to register and acquire a token
+ add authorisation middleware the a /pi/posts route, making it only is available to logged in users with a JSON web token



# Set up
Copy and paste the solution from the last lab(node-lab4) into a new folder called *node-lab5*. You can find a solution to the last lab [here](https://github.com/fxwalsh/node-samples-2018.git).

## Install dependencies
You'll need the following dependencies to implement the authentication functionality:

~~~bash
npm install --save passport passport-jwt jsonwebtoken bcrypt-nodejs
~~~


## Create Mongoose User Model

You will need to create a new user model for use in authentication and authorisation.  
+ Create a new folder **/api/users/** in the root project folder.
+ Create a new file called **userModel.js** and enter the following code:

~~~javascript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import bcrypt from  'bcrypt-nodejs';

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;


const UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: {
        type: String,
        unique: true,
        required: true,
    },
  password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
});

UserSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
    const user = this;
    if (this.isModified('password') || this.isNew) {
        bcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt)=> {
            if (err) {
                return next(err);
            }
            bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, null, (err, hash)=> {
                if (err) {
                    return next(err);
                }
                user.password = hash;
                next();
            });
        });
    } else {
        return next();
    }
});

UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function(passw, cb) {
    bcrypt.compare(passw, this.password, (err, isMatch) => {
        if (err) {
            return cb(err);
        }
        cb(null, isMatch);
    });
};

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
~~~

This script defines the schema for a user. Note that it includes a pre-save hook that encrypts the password property before it is saved or updated. Also, a comparePassword() instance method is added to the schema to allow authentication of users.

# Seed database with User Data
For development and testing purposes it would be a good idea to seed the database with some user data.

+ Create a new file called **userData.js** in the root foldes of the project and enter the following javascipt code:

~~~javascript
import userModel from './api/users/userModel';

const users = [
  {
    'username': 'user1',
    'password': 'test1',
  },
  {
    'username': 'user2',
    'password': 'test2',
  },
];

export const loadUsers = () => {
  userModel.find({}).remove(() => {
    users.forEach((user)=>{
                userModel.create(user, (err, docs)=>{
                if (err) {
                    console.log(`failed to Load User Data: ${err}`);
                }
                }
              );
});
    console.info(`${users.length} users were successfully stored.`);
});
};
~~~

+ Update the main script for the app,  **/index.js**,  to import userdata.js and run the loadUsers() function. Add the following lines of code to **/index.js** in the root folder. 

~~~javascript
...
import {loadUsers} from './usersData';
...

// Populate DB with sample data
if (process.env.seedDb) {
  loadContacts();
  loadPosts();
// ADD THE NEXT LINE :)
  loadUsers();
}

~~~ 

+ Open a terminal window in the root folder and start the app by entering ``npm start``. Comfirm that the users are being loaded by checking that you see the following console output:

~~~bash
[nodemon] starting `babel-node index.js`
body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option index.js:82:30
Server running at 8080
2 users were successfully stored.
4 contacts were successfully stored.
4 posts were successfully stored.
