# Hooking up the React App.
We will now connect your Hacker News React App to the API. This step requires completion of the React labs.

## System Architecture

We will keep using the **create-react-app** framework you were using previously. **create-react-app** provides a mechanism for working with an API server in development. We can have the development server proxy requests intended for our API server as follows:

![Development Architecture](./img/architecture.png)

The React app makes an API request to localhost:3000, the Webpack development server. The development server proxies that request to the API server. This will remove any Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) issues with the browser.
For this to work we need to launch both the create-react-app dev server and the API server in order to run the app locally. We also need to get the react dev server to proxy requests to the Express API.

+ Copy the complete hackerNews app from it's current location and put it in the root of your Express API (node-lab2). It should look like this:  
![HackerNews folder](./img/files.png)

+ Open a console window in the hackerNews folder and start the react app:
```
npm start
```

Check that the app functions as before. If it's not working then check the error messages if any.

## Set up

#### Nodemon filter
We want the nodemon process to ignore any changes in the hackerNews folder as these will not affect the API. In the **package.json file in the lab-Node2 root folder**, update the scripts property to the following:

```json
"scripts": {
      "start":  "nodemon --ignore hackerNews/* --exec babel-node server.js"
    }
```

#### Proxy Server
To have the React development server proxy our API requests to our Express API server, we need to add the following to the **package.json file in the hackerNews folder.**   
```json
"proxy":"http://localhost:8080",
```

This should forward any request for unknown resources though to our Express app listening on port 8080.

#### Axios

We will need to make http requests to the Express API from the React App. In the **hackerNews** folder, install **axois**.

```
npm install --save axios
```

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. You will use it to make requests to the Express API.

### Start both servers
You will need to now start both the react app server and the Express API at the same time. Open two separate command windowsin the hackerNews folder and the parent lab folder. Start the respective servers in both windows:

```
npm start
```

You should see both processes come to life. As before, they support 'hot code changes' so you should not have to restart the processes as you moake changes.

## Integrate the Express Hacker News API

Currently the Hacker News app uses a stubAPI to mimic a real API. We will nowcreplace this with functionality that integrates with our API.  We also need to manage JWT tokens in local storage in the browser.

+ In the hackerNews/src folder create a file called **auth.js** with the following content:   

```javascript
class Auth {

  /**
   * Authenticate a user. Save a token string in Local Storage
   *
   * @param {string} token
   */
  static authenticateUser(token) {
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
  }

  /**
   * Check if a user is authenticated - check if a token is saved in Local Storage
   *
   * @returns {boolean}
   */
  static isUserAuthenticated() {
    return localStorage.getItem('token') !== null;
  }

  /**
   * Deauthenticate a user. Remove a token from Local Storage.
   *
   */
  static deauthenticateUser() {
    localStorage.removeItem('token');


  /**
   * Get a token value.
   *
   * @returns {string}
   */

  static getToken() {
    return localStorage.getItem('token');
  }

}

export default Auth;

```

+ Create a new script in the *hackerNews/src* folder called **api.js** and enter the following code:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import auth from './auth';
export const upvote = async (postId) => {
   axios.post(`/api/posts/${postId}/upvote`)
              .then(resp => resp.data);
};

export const getAll = async () => {
   const resp = await axios.get('/api/posts',{headers: {'Authorization': auth.getToken()}},)
   return resp.data;
};

export const getPost = async (postId) => {
  const resp = await axios.get(`/api/posts/${postId}`,{headers: {'Authorization': auth.getToken()}})
  return resp.data;
};

export const add = async (newTitle, newLink) => {
  const resp = await axios.post('/api/posts',{title: newTitle, link: newLink }, {headers: {'Authorization': auth.getToken()}});
  return resp.data;
};

export const login = async (username, password) => {
  const resp = await axios.post('/api/users', { username: username, password: password });
  return resp.data;
};

export const signup = async (username, password) => {
  const resp = await axios.post('/api/users?action=register', { username: username, password: password });
  return resp.data;
};
```

Notice how the routes match what we've implemented in the Express API. The proxy property in the HackerNews *package.json* provides the host information required to complete the request(i.e. localhast:8080).

+ In the ``hackerNews/src``, edit ``App.js`` as follows: Add and import statement for the new **api** package.

```javascript
import * as api from './api';
```

+ We are going to place the posts returned from the Express API in the HackerApp component state. We will only show the NewsList component if we sucessfully retrieve all posts from the API. We include an *isHidden* property to indicate this.
In *App.js*, add the  function  ``componentDidMount()`` to the HackerApp component to initialise the posts from the Express API:

```javascript
class HackerApp extends React.Component {
 state = {posts: [{}]};
 async componentDidMount () {
   try{
         const resp = await api.getAll();
         this.setState({
                  posts: resp,
                  isHidden: false,
                });

      } catch (e){
        this.setState({
                 isHidden: true
               });
      }
 };
    ...
    ...
```

+ Now replace the ``render`` function of the HackerApp component with the following code. This replaces the previous use of stubAPI with the new posts state retrieved from the api package.

```javascript
render() {
  const posts = _.sortBy(this.state.posts, post =>
        post.upvotes);
  return (
    <div>
    {!this.state.isHidden && <NewsList posts={posts}
          upvoteHandler={this.incrementUpvote} />}
     <Form addHandler={this.addPost} />
   </div>
  );
}
```

Now have a look at the app in the browser. You should see the list of news items as before. This time, however, they are retrieved from the Express API.
Try to add a new post. You'll notice nothing happens. Next we will update the addPost() method.

### Adding a post

+ Locate the ``addPost`` function in the HackerApp component. Replace it with the following:

```javascript
...
addPost = async (title, link) => {
  try{
    const resp = await api.add(title, link);
    const newPost = {"id":resp.id,"title":title,"link":link,"upvotes":0, "comments":[]};
    this.setState({posts: this.state.posts.concat([newPost])});
  } catch(e){
    alert(`failed to add post: ${e}`);
  }
};
...
```
This function calls the Express API using async/await. When the await returns, then it pushes the new post onto the posts state property. The HackerApp should react to this state and call the render function again.

Check the app in the browser again. You should be able add posts to the list.

### Upvoting a Post

The upvote will cause errors if you try to use it at the moment.
Replace the **incrementUpvote** function in the ReactApp component with the following:

```javascript

incrementUpvote = async (id) => {
try{
  await api.upvote(id)
  var upvotedPost = _.find(this.state.posts, post=>post.id === id);
  upvotedPost.upvotes++;
  this.setState({})} catch(e){
    alert(`failed to upvote post ${id}: ${e}`);
  }
};
```
Nowstart the application. You will probably notice you get a proxy message failure message as the react app tries to start.

~~~bash
roxy error: Could not proxy request /api/posts from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:8080.
See https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors for more information (ECONNREFUSED).
~~~

This is because the react app (the client) has not retrieved a valid Javascript Web Token to use the HackerNews Express API.
In the next part, we will include a Login page to allow user authentication.
